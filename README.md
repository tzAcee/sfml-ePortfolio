Maxims ePortfolio with the topic SFML &amp; Solution for the exercise

## Welcome
When you want to get the code, you will have to clone it and adjust your linker and your include directory like I showed you in my setup or you
just follow the steps SFML provided to do so.

You can also find my slides here, if you want to look ups an links.

Have a nice Day!
